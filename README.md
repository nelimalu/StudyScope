# StudyScope

## About
StudyScope tutoring is a Toronto-based student-run tutoring program. The way StudyScope stands out is that it has its own curriculum built by students. It also offers a wide range of subjects and services at competitive pricing. 

Studyscope tutoring has only recently officially launched with limited advertising but hasnâ€™t received much traction because the website and the curriculum haven't been completed yet. When they are completed however, Studyscope plans to start advertising heavily to gain attention. Even now, StudyScope is starting to put up advertisements in order to gain a little money and size in order to be able to hire more students to help with the curriculum development.
